    <p>As the little prince drifted into sleep, I gently carried him in my arms and walked on. 
       I <span class="strong-underline">felt a deep emotion stirring within me</span>, as though I were holding something delicate and precious. 
       <span class="hl-yellow">It seemed to me that nothing on Earth could be more fragile.</span>
    </p>

    <p>Bathed in moonlight, I gazed at his face—his closed eyes, his soft hair quivering in the breeze—and thought to myself: 
       <span class="emph-red">“What I see is only a shell. What truly matters lies within, unseen.”</span>
    </p>

    <p>When his lips curved into the faintest smile, I reflected again: 
       <span class="emph-red">“What touches me so profoundly is this child’s devotion to his flower—the vision of a rose illuminating his life, glowing like the flame of a lamp, even in his sleep.”</span>
    </p>

    <p>And in that moment, I felt an even greater tenderness, as though he were a flame himself, 
       one that could be extinguished by the gentlest breath of wind.</p>
